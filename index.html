            <p>Some of my Godot and Scratch games I made are somes like a UFO game where you got to click the ufo and not the bombs.
                Also another Godot game I made was a Choose your own adventure game. (Sort of like Zork.)
                A Scratch game I made was a basketball game. 
                (yeah, thats sort of all of the game I made that I remeber.)

            <p>3 of my websites I have was were, First Website, Company Website, and Responsive Portfolio.
                My first website was about lists of food from different reigons of the world. (I was bad 
                at geography when I made it.) Now the Company website was mostly a sketchy online game store with
                three knockoff games. Finally, the Responsive Portfolio was about me explaning what I made. (like games,
                Websites, arduino.)
